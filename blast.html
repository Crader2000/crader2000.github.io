                    <p><strong>B.L.A.S.T.</strong> is a multiplayer FPS game with a focus on chaotic, non-stop action with PvEvP elements. In
                    this game, you fight off the alien invasion of Area 52 with a modular alien gun that changes the ammo and behavior of 
                    the gun.</p>

                    <!-- MY ROLE -->
                    <p><strong>I worked on two teams during development.</strong> For the first half of the year, I was a part of designing the
                        movement system for B.L.A.S.T. Our job was to design a movement system that felt fast, smooth and had dynamic options for
                        movement such as sliding or climbing. Some inspirations we had were Titanfall, Team Fortress 2 and Battlefront 2.</p>
                    <p><strong>For the second half,</strong> moved to the UI team where I worked on the UI that is seen during a game. I worked
                        primarily in C++ for the in game UI. It was my job to make sure the mods, ammo, player health and points were displaying 
                        correctly. During this time, I worked closely with the networking and tools team to get the correct info needed for the
                        UI.</p>

                                </a>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <video width="500" height="280" controls loop>

                    <p><strong>I wanted to use a mixed approach with blueprints and C++</strong>, the functunality of the widgets would be in the
                        C++ files and they would have blueprint callable functions that would be called in a blueprint from the editer. I made a 
                        widget blueprint that used the C++ files as a parent, so any public functions and variables were accessible from the widget
                        side. The visual aspects, such as the placement and size, were also edited in the widget blueprint but the necessary 
                        elements were made in the C++ files.</p>
